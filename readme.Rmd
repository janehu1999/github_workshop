## Scraping Data

-- SPOOKY SZN

Since we are rolling up on the spookiest holiday, it might be worth pulling in some data on horror movies. Not surprisingly, Wikipedia has some information about the top-grossing horror movies of all time.

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(rvest)

topGrossingLink <- 
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_horror_films"

horrorMovies <- read_html(topGrossingLink) %>% 
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>% 
  `[[`(1)

kable_material(kable(horrorMovies), 
               c("striped", "hover"))
```

As per usual, we will likely need to clean some of those dollar values up just a little bit:

```{r}
horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross` <- gsub("\\$|,", 
                                       "", 
                                       horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross`)

horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross` <- as.numeric(horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross`)
```

All looks good now!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
skimr::skim(horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross`)
```

Which studios tend to do well with making money off horror?

```{r}
horrorMovies <- as.data.table(horrorMovies)

sortedStudio <- horrorMovies[, 
                             .(average = mean(`Worldwide gross`)), 
                             by = Studio][order(-average)]

kable_material(kable(sortedStudio), 
               c("striped", "hover"))
```


## Plotting Data

Just for the fun of it, let's do some plotting over the years:

```{r}
ggplot(horrorMovies, aes(x = Year, y = `Worldwide gross`, label = Film)) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(size = 2) +
  theme_minimal()

# If you want to get fancy with plotly, that
# code is below:

# plot_ly(horrorMovies, x = ~Year, y = ~`Worldwide gross`,
#         type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
#         text = ~paste("Film: ", Film, '<br>Studio: ', Studio, sep = ""))
```

We saw some averages for the studios earlier, so let's get a better idea about each studios distribution within the list:

```{r}
ggplot(horrorMovies, aes(x = `Worldwide gross`, y = Studio)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal()

# plot_ly(horrorMovies, x = ~`Worldwide gross`, y = ~Studio, 
#         type = "box")
```

## Relationship Exploration

Let's see if we can get into any relationships between movie information and money.

We can load in our `horrorOut` data:

```{r}
load("data/horrorOut.RData")
```

And join it with our highest-grossing data:

```{r}
horrorOut$Year <- as.integer(horrorOut$Year)

allData <- merge.data.table(horrorMovies, horrorOut, 
                            by.x = c("Film", "Year"), 
                            by.y = c("Title", "Year"))
dim(allData)
```

It looks like we lost a few movies!

I suppose you never know what might be creeping around with your data until you try to work with it!

![](images/pennywise.gif)

```{r}
horrorMovies$Film[!horrorMovies$Film %in% horrorOut$Title]

horrorOut$Title[!horrorMovies$Film %in% horrorOut$Title]
```

That's just silly...but since it is just a few, we won't worry about a fuzzy join.

```{r}
horrorMovies$Film[
  horrorMovies$Film == "Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"
  ] <- "Resident Evil the Final Chapter: Explore the Hive"

horrorMovies$Film[
  horrorMovies$Film == "Interview with the Vampire"
  ] <- "Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"
```

Now, we should be set to join:

```{r}
allData <- merge.data.table(horrorMovies, horrorOut, 
                            by.x = c("Film", "Year"), 
                            by.y = c("Title", "Year"))

dim(allData)
```

As per usual, we will need to clean up some variables before we can use them:

```{r}
ratingVars <- c("Internet Movie Database", 
                "Metacritic", 
                "Rotten Tomatoes")

# We need to remove special characters in the ratings columns:

allData[, 
        (ratingVars) := lapply(.SD, function(x) {
          as.numeric(gsub("/[0-1]+|%", "", x))
        }), 
        .SDcols = ratingVars]

# And let's multiply IMDB by 10 to put it on the same scale as the others:

allData$`Internet Movie Database` <- allData$`Internet Movie Database` * 10
```

Let's check on some correlations between the ratings and gross:

```{r}
corData <- allData[, 
                   .(`Worldwide gross`, `Internet Movie Database`, 
                     Metacritic, `Rotten Tomatoes`)]

GGally::ggcorr(corData)
```

There are a few frequent fliers on this list, so let's see how those folks typically do:

```{r}
repeatedDirectors <- unique(allData$Director[duplicated(allData$Director)])

repeatDirectorData <- allData[Director %in% repeatedDirectors, ]
```

Absolutely wild that 9 people account for about half of the top 50 money-wise, but what about quality?

```{r}
plotData <- melt.data.table(
  repeatDirectorData[, 
                     .(Director, `Rotten Tomatoes`, 
                       Metacritic, `Internet Movie Database`)], 
  id.vars = "Director", 
  measure.vars = c("Rotten Tomatoes", 
                   "Metacritic", "Internet Movie Database"))

ggplot(plotData, 
       aes(x = value, y = Director, color = variable)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Seems like Jordan Peele's brand of socially-drive horror is quality. 

Which movies are "Fresh"?

```{r}
allData[`Rotten Tomatoes` > 69, list(Film, `Rotten Tomatoes`)]
```

And then "Rotten"?

```{r}
allData[`Rotten Tomatoes` < 70, list(Film, `Rotten Tomatoes`)]
```

Let's see what a regression might get us:

```{r}
rtGross <- lm(`Worldwide gross` ~ `Rotten Tomatoes`, 
              data = allData)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
stargazer::stargazer(rtGross, type = "html", header = FALSE)
```



## Top 100

```{r}
top100Link <- "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_horror_movies/"

allTables <- read_html(top100Link) %>% 
  html_table() 
  
tableNames <- lapply(allTables, function(x) names(x))

tableNumber <- grep("Rank", tableNames)

top100Table <- allTables[[tableNumber]]

top100Table$Title <- gsub("\\s\\(.*[0-9]{4}\\)$", "", top100Table$Title)

allData$Film[allData$Film %in% top100Table$Title]
```

Cool stuff.
