Did someone say Halloween?

## Scraping Data

Since we are rolling up on the spookiest holiday -- Halloween, it might be worth pulling in some data on horror movies. Not surprisingly, Wikipedia has some information about the top-grossing horror movies of all time.

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(rvest)

topGrossingLink <- 
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_horror_films"

horrorMovies <- read_html(topGrossingLink) %>% 
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>% 
  `[[`(1)

kable_material(kable(horrorMovies), 
               c("striped", "hover"))
```

As per usual, we will likely need to clean some of those dollar values up just a little bit:

```{r}
horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross` <- gsub("\\$|,", 
                                       "", 
                                       horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross`)

horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross` <- as.numeric(horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross`)
```

All looks good now!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
skimr::skim(horrorMovies$`Worldwide gross`)
```

Which studios tend to do well with making money off horror?

```{r}
horrorMovies <- as.data.table(horrorMovies)

sortedStudio <- horrorMovies[, 
                             .(average = mean(`Worldwide gross`)), 
                             by = Studio][order(-average)]

kable_material(kable(sortedStudio), 
               c("striped", "hover"))
```


## Plotting Data

Just for the fun of it, let's do some plotting over the years:

```{r}
ggplot(horrorMovies, aes(x = Year, y = `Worldwide gross`, label = Film)) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(size = 2) +
  theme_minimal()

# If you want to get fancy with plotly, that
# code is below:

# plot_ly(horrorMovies, x = ~Year, y = ~`Worldwide gross`,
#         type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
#         text = ~paste("Film: ", Film, '<br>Studio: ', Studio, sep = ""))
```

We saw some averages for the studios earlier, so let's get a better idea about each studios distribution within the list:

```{r}
ggplot(horrorMovies, aes(x = `Worldwide gross`, y = Studio)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal()

# plot_ly(horrorMovies, x = ~`Worldwide gross`, y = ~Studio, 
#         type = "box")
```

## Relationship Exploration

Let's see if we can get into any relationships between movie information and money.

We can load in our `horrorOut` data:

```{r}
load("data/horrorOut.RData")
```

And join it with our highest-grossing data:

```{r}
horrorOut$Year <- as.integer(horrorOut$Year)

allData <- merge.data.table(horrorMovies, horrorOut, 
                            by.x = c("Film", "Year"), 
                            by.y = c("Title", "Year"))
dim(allData)
```

It looks like we lost a few movies!

I suppose you never know what might be creeping around with your data until you try to work with it!

![](images/pennywise.gif)

```{r}
horrorMovies$Film[!horrorMovies$Film %in% horrorOut$Title]

horrorOut$Title[!horrorMovies$Film %in% horrorOut$Title]
```

That's just silly...but since it is just a few, we won't worry about a fuzzy join.

```{r}
horrorMovies$Film[
  horrorMovies$Film == "Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"
  ] <- "Resident Evil the Final Chapter: Explore the Hive"

horrorMovies$Film[
  horrorMovies$Film == "Interview with the Vampire"
  ] <- "Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"
```

Now, we should be set to join:

```{r}
allData <- merge.data.table(horrorMovies, horrorOut, 
                            by.x = c("Film", "Year"), 
                            by.y = c("Title", "Year"))

dim(allData)
```

As per usual, we will need to clean up some variables before we can use them:

```{r}
ratingVars <- c("Internet Movie Database", 
                "Metacritic", 
                "Rotten Tomatoes")

# We need to remove special characters in the ratings columns:

allData[, 
        (ratingVars) := lapply(.SD, function(x) {
          as.numeric(gsub("/[0-1]+|%", "", x))
        }), 
        .SDcols = ratingVars]

# And let's multiply IMDB by 10 to put it on the same scale as the others:

allData$`Internet Movie Database` <- allData$`Internet Movie Database` * 10
```

Let's check on some correlations between the ratings and gross:

```{r}
corData <- allData[, 
                   .(`Worldwide gross`, `Internet Movie Database`, 
                     Metacritic, `Rotten Tomatoes`)]

GGally::ggcorr(corData)
```

There are a few frequent fliers on this list, so let's see how those folks typically do:

```{r}
repeatedDirectors <- unique(allData$Director[duplicated(allData$Director)])

repeatDirectorData <- allData[Director %in% repeatedDirectors, ]
```

Absolutely wild that 9 people account for about half of the top 50 money-wise, but what about quality?

```{r}
plotData <- melt.data.table(
  repeatDirectorData[, 
                     .(Director, `Rotten Tomatoes`, 
                       Metacritic, `Internet Movie Database`)], 
  id.vars = "Director", 
  measure.vars = c("Rotten Tomatoes", 
                   "Metacritic", "Internet Movie Database"))

ggplot(plotData, 
       aes(x = value, y = Director, color = variable)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Seems like Jordan Peele's brand of socially-drive horror is quality. 

Which movies are "Fresh"?

```{r}
allData[`Rotten Tomatoes` > 69, list(Film, `Rotten Tomatoes`)]
```

And then "Rotten"?

```{r}
allData[`Rotten Tomatoes` < 70, list(Film, `Rotten Tomatoes`)]
```

Let's see what a regression might get us:

```{r}
rtGross <- lm(`Worldwide gross` ~ `Rotten Tomatoes`, 
              data = allData)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
stargazer::stargazer(rtGross, type = "html", header = FALSE)
```



## Top 100

```{r}
top100Link <- "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_horror_movies/"

allTables <- read_html(top100Link) %>% 
  html_table() 
  
tableNames <- lapply(allTables, function(x) names(x))

tableNumber <- grep("Rank", tableNames)

top100Table <- allTables[[tableNumber]]

top100Table$Title <- gsub("\\s\\(.*[0-9]{4}\\)$", "", top100Table$Title)

allData$Film[allData$Film %in% top100Table$Title]
```

Cool stuff.
